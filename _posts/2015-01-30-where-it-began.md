经过不断的尝试总算是完成了这个自己大体满意的博客，并且成功发布到github上，终于完成了这个已经拖了半年之久的小目标。	  
最早开始想写博客是在网上看到了“[璐璐的幸福生活](http://dongluinuk.com/)”,博客的内容很是打动了我。我不仅仅憧憬他所描述的生活，更希望也用相同的方式来记录自己的生活。于是尝试了各种不同的网上博客，我又想在博客中记录自己学习的各种总计以及感受，于是这样的博客限制了自由。我开始尝试github提供的个人博客，在学期初匆匆忙忙的接触之后就搁置了下来，总算是在寒假期间实现了个人博客。   

下面是摘自“璐璐的幸福生活”中的一篇短片博客：
>"In recent years, I was inspired by those people who live so earnestly, they write blog, they make video, they publish book, they have a happy family. They seem to own everything that one could possibly imagine. I was just amazed of how can they achieve so much in their life. They utilize and appreciate every second in their life, which makes me jealous.  I said to myself one day I want to be one of them. 
Therefore, I set up a system to set and track my goals. Will share it in my blog as soon as it works for me."
